Defining a new Trainer Type w/ Sprite
- Add the sprite to the folder
- Add extern consts for sprite and pallete in include/graphics.h
- Insert file references to data/graphics/trainers.h
- #define trainer pic in include/constants/trainers.h
- Add in data/trainer_graphics/front_pic_tables.h the scale/offset, the sprite to the frontPicTable, and the pallete to the frontPicPaletteTable
- Add in data/trainer_graphics/front_pic_anims.h
- Add in data/pokemon/trainer_class_lookups.h in both arrays
- #define in include/constants/opponents.h. Be careful about adding too many as there is a hard limit defined
